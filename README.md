Simple application for a Laundry.

This was my first .net Project.
The goals were to create a platform where users could:

  1- Register and Register an Address.
  2- Create a scheduling where the Laundry would send an employee to pickup the cloths.
  3- Cloths would be cleaned and returned to the user's address.
 
 Basic projet using .net, JavaScript and HTML.
